GENERAL NOTES ON HOW THE NEURAL NETWORK ACTAULLY WORKS

- For categorising, the last layer should have same shape as the number of categories
- The last layer has to be softmax in the model in order to conver to a normalised percentage 
- I that layer can be either a Dense() layer with softmax activation or a Softmax() layer
 
- The resulting array displays confidence for each category.
- Argmax(result) to get the model's most likely answer.


- no clue what the fuck the middle layers do.
